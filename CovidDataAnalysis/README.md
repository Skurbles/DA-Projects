Sorry for the mess, I'm renovating the site. I promise it'll be more impressive than a unicorn riding a dinosaur once it's done.

This project will mainly contain examples of MySQL database creation and manipulation with SQL queries to return specific data. Dataset used for this project acquired from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, and processed/cleaned with Excel prior to importing into MySQL Database. Data Output will be picked over to create Tableau visualizations as a separate but related project. Tableau project will have pdf exports added until if/when embed can be added.

The primary focus will be to show examples of proficiency in SQL queries and translation into visual dashboard using Tableau.
